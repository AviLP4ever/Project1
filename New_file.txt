Github is a config management tool used for version controlled applications which is most commonly adapted in any of the industries where server based applications are run.
There are other tools available for creating the online repositories ,i.e SVN or CVS,but Github is commonly used in the industry where both application and command line Git are used.


Create pull request option is done on the repository which is local to your machine. This pull request will be open in the cloud server,changes will be created if different content is available. After clicking on merge pull request, all the contents of a particular branch will be synced with master. Also we can merge and update the contents into a branch and a master locally. After that it is necessary to sync the contents of one another. We can also compare across forks in order to see the changes of a master and a branch.
There is always one pull request of a branch and a master.
